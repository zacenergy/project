# Project Images

This folder contains placeholder images for the portfolio projects. 

To customize your portfolio:

1. Replace the placeholder images with actual screenshots of your projects
2. Name them project1.jpg, project2.jpg, project3.jpg (or update the HTML accordingly)
3. Recommended image dimensions: 400x250px for best display

You can use free placeholder images from:
- https://picsum.photos/400/250 (generates random images)
- https://via.placeholder.com/400x250 (solid color placeholders)
- Create your own project screenshots
